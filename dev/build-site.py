"""Build site/ from the design export in dev/site-src, fetching nothing.

    python3 dev/build-site.py

The export is a Design Component page: a <x-dc> template, a logic class in a
<script type="text/x-dc"> block, and a runtime (support.js) that mounts the
two with React. Shipped as exported it reaches three hosts at view time, which
is a problem specific to this page rather than a general one: it renders the
sentence "no hosted control plane, no licence check, no CDN font" while
fetching a font from a CDN.

So three changes, and only three:

  1. React and ReactDOM load from site/vendor instead of unpkg. support.js
     calls loadReactUmd(), which returns early when both globals already
     exist, so the CDN constants it carries are never reached. Babel was never
     reached to begin with: ensureBabel() is called only from the x-import
     path, and this page has no x-import.
  2. The Google Fonts @import goes, and the three families fall back to the
     platform's own. Self-hosting the real ones would also have worked and
     would have cost 150KB of woff2 for a closer match; the system stacks cost
     nothing and the page is mostly monospace anyway.
  3. The design system's marketing and ui-kit stylesheets and its 288KB
     component bundle are dropped. The page uses no class from any of them,
     and the bundle is where every link to an unrelated project came from.

ci/site-offline.sh is what holds all of that: it serves the built directory
and renders it with every name but loopback unresolvable.
