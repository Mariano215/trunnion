# Wiring the console into the binary

Six text files, no build step, no binary asset. The logo is a data URI inside
`console.css`, so `include_str!` covers everything and nothing needs
`include_bytes!`.

Paths below are relative to `src/console.rs`.

## The asset table

```rust
/// The console's static assets, embedded at build time. Text only: the logo
/// travels as a data URI inside the stylesheet, so there is no binary asset
/// and no second process serving files.
const ASSETS: &[(&str, &str, &str)] = &[
    ("/",             include_str!("../assets/index.html"), "text/html; charset=utf-8"),
    ("/index.html",   include_str!("../assets/index.html"), "text/html; charset=utf-8"),
    ("/console.css",  include_str!("../assets/console.css"), "text/css; charset=utf-8"),
    ("/app.js",       include_str!("../assets/app.js"),   "text/javascript; charset=utf-8"),
    ("/api.js",       include_str!("../assets/api.js"),   "text/javascript; charset=utf-8"),
    ("/ui.js",        include_str!("../assets/ui.js"),    "text/javascript; charset=utf-8"),
    ("/views.js",     include_str!("../assets/views.js"), "text/javascript; charset=utf-8"),
    ("/trace.js",     include_str!("../assets/trace.js"), "text/javascript; charset=utf-8"),
];

/// Body and content type for a static path. `None` means the caller should
/// serve the shell, because the front end owns its own routing.
fn asset(path: &str) -> Option<(&'static str, &'static str)> {
    ASSETS.iter().find(|(p, _, _)| *p == path).map(|(_, body, ct)| (*body, *ct))
}

/// The shell, served for every non-API path that is not one of the assets
/// above. Matches the rule in docs/CONSOLE-API.md.
fn shell() -> (&'static str, &'static str) {
    (include_str!("../assets/index.html"), "text/html; charset=utf-8")
}
```

## Request routing

In the order the console needs:

1. `path` starts with `/api/` — the API router owns it. An unknown `/api/*`
   path is 404 with a `Fault` body, never the shell. A shell served under a
   JSON content type would make `fetch` fail with a parse error instead of a
   readable fault.
2. `asset(path)` returns `Some` — serve that body and content type.
3. anything else — serve `shell()` with 200.

The four ES modules are requested by absolute path (`/app.js` imports
`/api.js`, `/ui.js` and `/views.js`, and `/views.js` imports `/trace.js`), so
those exact paths must resolve. A
module served under a content type that is not a JavaScript MIME type is
refused by the browser and the console renders as a blank shell, so the
`text/javascript` above is load-bearing, not cosmetic.

`index.html` references `/console.css` and `/app.js` only. Everything else is
reached through module imports.

## Headers

- `content-length` on every response, as the existing scorecard handler
  already does.
- `cache-control: no-store` on `/api/*`, because every response is derived
  from the ledger on the request and a cached page is a page that may be wrong.
- `cache-control: no-cache` on the assets is enough. They change only when the
  binary changes, and no-cache still lets a revalidation return 304 if the
  handler ever grows an ETag.

## What the console assumes

- Same origin for everything. There is no absolute URL anywhere in `assets/`:
  no font, no script, no image, no `fetch` to any host. Grep for `http` in
  `assets/` returns only the SVG namespace and the inline data URI.
- The API answers exactly the shapes in `docs/CONSOLE-API.md`. Where the
  contract is silent the front end degrades and says so on screen rather than
  guessing (for example an unreadable `/api/events/:id` renders as "position
  unavailable", never as a fabricated index).
- `/api/verify` is read before any view mounts. A body with `ok: false`, and a
  read that fails outright, both take the interface over. A 404 does not: that
  is a console started without a ledger, and it lands on the workspace view
  with the ledger routes marked as having no log to read. "There is no log
  here" and "the log here is damaged" are different states, and rendering the
  first as the second would put an alarm on a console doing exactly what it
  was started to do.

## Not embedded

`dev/` is developer tooling: a fixture server and two fixture sets. Nothing in
`src/` may reference it, and no `include_str!` points at it.
