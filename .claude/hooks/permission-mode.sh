# PreToolUse hook, Bash matcher. Claude Code's hook input carries the
# session's real permission_mode; nothing else on the machine knows it.
# This hook injects that value as CLAUDE_PERMISSION_MODE into any Bash
# command that invokes trunnion, so gateway::permission_mode_check
# (src/gateway.rs) records the observed mode on every event instead of
# writing "unobserved". ci/permission-mode-hook exercises this script
# directly with fixture input; see ci/run.sh.
#
# A command with no "trunnion" in it is a negative control: this hook must
# leave it untouched (exit with `{}`), or it would be rewriting commands it
# has no business touching.
#
# This hook never returns a permissionDecision. Omitting it applies the
# rewrite and leaves the normal permission evaluation in force, which is the
# only acceptable behaviour here: returning "allow" would auto-approve every
# Bash command containing the substring "trunnion", widening the session's real
# authority beyond what .claude/settings.json declares. That is the exact
# drift this project detects, and a hook that caused it while measuring it
# would be worse than no hook.
