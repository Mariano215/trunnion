//! Slice 15: the drift check, the sensor half of primitive 12.
//!
//! `docs/POLICY-SCHEMA.md` makes `observed_by` a required field on every
//! profile requirement. This module is the thing that reads those sources.
//! It walks `profile_requirements`, reads each source from the running
//! system, and produces one outcome per field: `match`, `divergence`, or
//! `unobservable`.
//!
//! The rule the whole module is built around: a source this build cannot
//! actually read reports `unobservable`, never `match`. Two values that agree
//! because neither was read is the failure this project exists to prevent, and
//! it is easy to write by accident, because the naive implementation of the
//! egress check reads the sandbox allowlist that was generated from the very
//! policy field being checked and finds it equal every time.
//!
//! An `observed_by` naming a source no code reads is a gap in the report, not
//! an error that stops the walk. A walk that aborted on the first unknown
//! source would report nothing about the fields it had not reached yet, which
//! is the opposite of what a scheduled scan is for.
