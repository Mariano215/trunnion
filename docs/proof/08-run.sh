# Proof 08: score the platform with itself. Build one ledger that exercises
# the layers, then run gantry score over it. The numbers come from telemetry,
# not from the profile name, so low numbers cannot be dressed up. Run from the
# repository root after cargo build. The one model call uses the local ollama
# endpoint. If it is down the call still appends a model.call carrying its
# prompt hash and window before returning the Fault, so primitives 2 and 3
# score the same either way; what is lost is the reply, the exit status and
# the seal, not the telemetry. This comment claimed N/A for eight slices and
# was wrong.
