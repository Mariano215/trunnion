# Proof 19: two scoring levels that credit a control running, never what it
# found.
#
#   primitive 07 level 4: the policy held a call at an irreversible step and a
#                         human answered it on the record.
#   primitive 12 level 4: gantry drift walked the profile requirements and
#                         reported every field, and run open recorded what this
#                         machine could not provide.
#
# Proof 13 records what happens when a level is keyed on an outcome instead:
# the first instruction-lifecycle rule credited the sensor's failure message,
# so a repository whose control passed scored 3 and one whose control was
# broken scored 4, and the way to raise the number was to break the check.
# This script asserts the property that would have caught it. For each level,
# two ledgers that differ only in what the control found must score the same,
# and a ledger where the control never ran must score lower.
#
# Run from the repository root after cargo build. Fully offline: no model call,
# and the released publish command names a remote that does not exist, so it
# fails locally and reaches no network.
