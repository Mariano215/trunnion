# Proof 13: instruction lifecycle telemetry. Primitive 1 was capped at 3
# because instructions/pack.md was pinned by hash on every run.open but
# nothing recorded whether a change to it had been reviewed. The
# instruction-lifecycle sensor (templates/laptop/config/sensors) compares an
# artifact's hash against config/instruction-reviews.jsonl and fails when the
# hash is not there.
#
# What earns level 4 is that the control ran, never that it failed. An
# earlier version of this rule credited 4 from the sensor's failure message,
# which meant a repository with a properly reviewed pack scored 3 and one
# with an unreviewed change scored 4. That is backwards and gameable: the way
# to raise the number would have been to break the review. The rule now names
# the sensor and not its outcome.
#
# So this script proves three things: a passing gate earns the level, a
# failing gate earns the same level and additionally blocks, and a ledger
# where the sensor never ran does not earn it at all. Run from the repository
# root after cargo build. No network needed; the one model call in
# `gantry run` is tolerated offline exactly as in proof 08.
