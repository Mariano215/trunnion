# ci/site-offline: the published page fetches nothing from any host.
#
# The page prints "no hosted control plane, no licence check, no CDN font" and
# is the first thing anyone sees. As exported by the design tool it reached
# unpkg for React and fonts.googleapis.com for three families, which made that
# sentence false on the page carrying it. dev/build-site.py removes both. This
# is what keeps them removed.
#
# Two halves, because either alone reports green on a page that is broken.
#
#   Static: every script, stylesheet and image the page references is a
#   relative path, and the stylesheet has no @import and no off-origin url().
#   This catches the regression by reading, before anything is served.
#
#   Rendered: serve site/ on loopback and render it with a resolver that maps
#   every name but 127.0.0.1 to NOTFOUND, then assert text that exists only
#   inside the logic script appears in the DOM. A page whose React never
#   loaded still returns HTTP 200 and still has a <body>, so asserting on the
#   response would pass for a blank screen. Asserting on rendered text from
#   the script block is asserting that the runtime ran with no host reachable.
#
# The check does not skip when the browser is missing, for the same reason
# ci/console-render.sh does not: a render check that passes when nothing
# rendered is a dead sensor reporting green.
#
# Run from the repository root.
