# ci/console-render: the console renders values that came off the ledger.
#
# Every other console check stops at the API boundary. tests/console.rs asserts
# the eight routes answer with the right shapes, and nothing asserts the front
# end reads them. A field renamed in src/console.rs would leave a blank cell on
# screen while every existing test still passed, which is the failure this
# check exists to catch.
#
# So: build a small ledger, serve it with the real binary, render each of the
# eight views in a headless browser, and assert that values taken from that
# ledger appear in the rendered DOM. The values are read out of the ledger
# files at check time, never hardcoded, so the check cannot drift into
# asserting a constant.
#
# Two things --dump-dom cannot do are covered by routing rather than by
# clicking. A row that expands on click is unreachable without a driver, but
# both the ledger view and the inbox open a row named in the URL, so
# #/ledger/<event id> and #/inbox/<call hash> render the expanded detail, and
# with it /api/events/:id. The verification takeover is covered by serving a
# second, altered ledger and rendering the same view against it: the takeover
# is what the router does before any view mounts, so no interaction is
# involved. What is still uncovered is anything that needs a real click, which
# is named at the end of docs/proof/20.md.
