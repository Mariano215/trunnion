# Trunnion

An LLM-agnostic control plane for agentic engineering. Implements the twelve
harness primitives as running services. Ships as a container. Scores itself.

Read `docs/CONCEPT.md` before changing architecture. Read `docs/PLAN.md`
before starting work — the slice order is deliberate and the proof gates are
not optional.

## The rule that governs this file

This project's entire thesis is that a layer carried only by a guide caps at
maturity 3. This file is a guide. Every rule below therefore names what
enforces it. A rule added here without an enforcing check is a defect in this
file, not a standard.

Rules with no enforcement yet are marked `[UNENFORCED]`. That marker is a
work item, and `trunnion scan` on this repo is expected to report it.

## Architecture invariants

- **One chokepoint.** Every model call and every tool call passes the gateway
  or the broker. A code path that reaches a provider SDK directly is a bug,
  because it is a hole in primitive 11. — enforced by `ci/no-direct-sdk`
- **The ledger is append-only.** No code mutates or deletes a ledger entry.
  Retention is expiry of the payload under a retained hash, never a rewrite.
  — enforced by `ci/ledger-append-only`
- **Secrets never enter a prompt or a tool argument.** Agents hold handles.
  The broker substitutes at the boundary. — enforced by `ci/secret-in-prompt`
- **No network in tests.** The full suite runs with an empty network
  namespace. This is what keeps the air-gap claim true. — enforced by
  `ci/offline-suite`
- **Profiles never lie.** Scores derive from what is running, never from the
  profile name. A scorer that reads configuration instead of telemetry is
  wrong. — `[UNENFORCED]` until slice 08

## Code standards

- Rust for the control plane. One static binary. The UI is static assets that
  binary serves — no second process in the container.
- Errors carry a fix, not just a cause. A sensor verdict or a policy denial is
  read by an agent, so the message must name the action to take. — enforced by
  `ci/message-lint`
- No `unwrap` or `expect` outside tests and `main`. — enforced by clippy
- Public types that appear in the event schema derive canonical JSON
  serialisation; field order and naming are schema-breaking changes.
  — enforced by `ci/schema-compat`
- Dependencies are added by a commit that says why. Anything with a network
  or process capability needs a note in `docs/DEPENDENCIES.md`.
  — `[UNENFORCED]`

## Working agreement for agents

- One slice at a time. Do not start slice N+1 while slice N has no proof
  document.
- A slice is done when `docs/proof/NN.md` exists, contains the adversarial
  case, the evidence, and the conformance delta — and the proof was produced
  by running the thing, not by reasoning about it.
- Prefer deleting a guide over letting it go stale. A false instruction is
  worse than a missing one; it looks like coverage.
- When something fails twice the same way, the fix is a sensor, not a third
  repair. Repairing the same defect by hand twice is the failure mode this
  project exists to prevent.

Direct and technical. Sentence case. No emoji. No exclamation marks. State
what the thing does; do not describe how transformative it is.
